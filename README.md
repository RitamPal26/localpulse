### Firecrawl

Implements dynamic web scraping triggered by user pull-to-refresh actions, searching for fresh local content including events, restaurants, news, and apartment listings across multiple sources.

### Convex

Serves as the real-time backend infrastructure, storing scraped events, user preferences, and providing instant synchronization across all connected devices.

### Better Auth

Provides secure, privacy-focused authentication with email/password flows, managing user sessions and protecting user data.

### Resend

Powers the "Share with Friends" feature, sending beautifully formatted emails with event details and personalized recommendations.

This expansion will transform LocalPulse from a metro-focused app into a **truly global local discovery platform**, making it useful for users anywhere‚Äîfrom small towns to major metropolitan areas.

### Additional Planned Features

- **Event reminders**: Push notifications for saved events
- **Community reviews**: Users can rate and review local places/events
